  abstract       = {According to the World Bank Report 2020, there is one fatal road crash
   every four minutes globally. Loss of lives and limbs seriously hampers
   the livelihood of the victims and their families. Despite cities'
   efforts to improve roads, crashes continue to occur worldwide. Road
   crashes are not accidents but preventable by systematic efforts in crash
   spot identification, prediction, and remedial actions. Road crashes
   occur due to various factors ranging between vehicle, weather, driver,
   or environmental categories. There is a need to establish methods of
   analysis that cities can quickly adopt to save lives. Traditionally
   statistical methods are used for crash zone identification, but
   recently, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) helped identify crash
   zones graphically while validating the results statistically. This
   review concerns road crash zone (Blackspot) identification GIS
   methodologies developed and adopted by cities between 2011 and 2022. It
   is found that GIS as a mapping tool has expanded into a data management
   system. It has high adaptability to integrate newer combinations with
   machine learning and fuzzy logic. The review finds that Kernel Density
   Estimation and Weighted Severity Index could be easy methods to adopt
   using local crash data, geocoding, and open-source software. It aims to
   assist cities with multi-modal traffic and two-wheeler dominance in
   future forms of research. The study is limited to transportation
   planning factors and GIS methodologies.},

   alternatives or complements of safety analyses mainly due to important
   road crash data availability and reliability limitations. Automated
   vehicles (AVs) have recently emerged as a prominent solution to mitigate
   transport externalities and increase road traffic safety. Due to the
   novelty of the technology and the lack of real-world data, traffic
   simulation combined with SSMs is the most common approach to quantify
   their impact. This study aims to provide an overview of the state of the
   practice and, more specifically, examine the applicability of applied
   SSMs on higher levels of AVs (HAVs).MethodsThe methodological approach
   consists of a comprehensive literature search, which aims to provide an
   overview of the applied SSMs, followed by a critical assessment of the
   findings.ResultsIn total, 17 studies and 11 different SSMs were
   identified and reviewed. Findings suggest that available SSMs are
   suitable measures to appropriately estimate the relative safety
   performance of HAVs and indicate their potential implications due to
   their expected rule-based driving behavior. However, in some cases, it
   was noticed that they could not efficiently capture the technological
   capabilities of HAVs, e.g., shorter headways and faster reaction times,
   which may lead to false alarms.ConclusionsDespite the available
   evidence, there are still significant gaps and certain limitations, as
   no comparisons between different measures exist, or the validity of the
   applied measures could not be assessed based on historical road crash
   data. This work aims to help researchers and practitioners choose the
   most appropriate SSMs to evaluate HAVs' safety performance. Finally,
   several research gaps are identified, and recommendations for potential
   future research directions are presented.},

Abstract = {Freeways in China have developed rapidly in recent years. The large
   traffic volumes and high travel speeds have created a serious safety
   problem that is of growing concern, however. Accurate identification of
   factors influencing crashes is a prerequisite for implementing
   countermeasures, but unobserved heterogeneity in crash data can lead to
   erroneous inferences. To identify key factors influencing crash
   occurrence, this study used two data preparation and modeling approaches
   to account for unobserved heterogeneity. First, freeway traffic crashes
   were divided into single-vehicle (SV) and multi-vehicle (MV) crashes
   because of their different mechanisms of occurrence. Second, random
   parameter modeling and finite mixture modeling were used, and were
   compared with regard to their ability to account for unobserved
   heterogeneity. The results indicated that the finite mixture negative
   binomial regression model with two components (FMNB-2) produced a better
   goodness-of-fit and parameter estimation. Results of the FMNB-2 SV and
   MV models' classification of crashes into two homogeneous subgroups
   showed that for both SV and MV, crashes in Component 1 were most
   affected by roadway geometric features, while in Component 2, crashes
   were more strongly associated with traffic operational conditions. These
   findings will help traffic managers implement more targeted
   countermeasures for freeway safety improvement.},

Title = {Red light camera interventions for reducing traffic violations and
   traffic crashes: A systematic review},
Journal = {CAMPBELL SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {BackgroundRoad traffic crashes are a major and increasing cause of
   injury and death around the world. In 2015, there were almost 6.3
   million motor vehicle traffic crashes in the United States. Of these,
   approximately 1.7 million (27\%) involved some form of injury and 32,166
   (0.5\%) resulted in one or more fatalities (National Highway Traffic
   Safety Administration, 2016, Traffic Safety Facts 2013: A Compilation of
   Motor Vehicle Crash Data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System and
   the General Estimates System). The most common cause of urban crashes
   appears to be drivers running red lights or ignoring other traffic
   controls and injuries occur in 39\% of all of these types of crashes
   (Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, IIHS, 2018, Red light running).
   While many drivers obey traffic signals, the possibility for violations
   exists due to issues such as driver distraction, aggressive driving
   behaviors, or a deliberate decision to ignore the traffic signal. One
   researcher suggests that eliminating traffic violations could reduce
   road injury crashes by up to 40\% (Zaal, 1994, Traffic law enforcement:
   A review of the literature). Red light cameras (RLCs) are an enforcement
   mechanism that permit police to remotely enforce traffic signals; they
   may serve as a deterrent to drivers who intentionally engage in red
   light running (RLR). The one previous systematic review of RLCs found
   that they were effective in reducing total casualty crashes but also
   found that evidence on the effectiveness of cameras on red light
   violations, total crashes, or specific types of casualty crashes was
   inconclusive. However, this review searched only a small number of
   electronic databases and was limited to a handful of studies published
   in 2002 or earlier.
   ObjectivesThis report updates and expands upon the previous Cochrane
   systematic review of RLCs. The aim of this review is to systematically
   review and synthesize the available evidence on the effectiveness of
   RLCs on the incidence of red light violations and the incidence and
   severity of various types of traffic crashes.
   Search MethodsThis study uses a four-part search strategy that involves:
   (a) searching 27 online electronic bibliographic databases for published
   and unpublished evaluations of RLCs; (b) searching the websites of 46
   international institutes and research agencies focusing on
   transportation issues for reports and other gray literature; (c)
   searching the reference lists of published studies to identify
   additional published and unpublished works; and (d) conducting a keyword
   search using Google and Google Scholar to search for additional gray
   literature.
   Selection CriteriaThe criteria for inclusion were determined before the
   search process began. To be eligible, studies must have assessed the
   impact of RLCs on red light violations and/or traffic crashes. Studies
   must have employed a quantitative research design that involved
   randomized controlled trials, quasi-random controlled trials, a
   controlled before-after design, or a controlled interrupted time series.
   Research that incorporated additional interventions, such as speed
   cameras or enhanced police enforcement, were excluded, although normal
   routine traffic enforcement in the nonintervention control condition was
   not excluded. Both published and unpublished reports were included.
   Studies were eligible regardless of the country in which they were
   conducted or the date of publication. Qualitative, observational, or
   descriptive studies that did not include formal comparisons of treatment
   and control groups were excluded from this research.
   Data Collection and AnalysisInitial searches produced a total of 5,708
   references after duplicates were removed. After title and abstract
   screening, a total of 121 references remained. Full-text review of these
   works identified 28 primary studies meeting the inclusion criteria, in
   addition to the 10 studies identified in the prior Cochrane review.
   Because several of the primary studies reported on multiple independent
   study areas, this report evaluates 41 separate analyses. At least two
   review authors independently assessed all records for eligibility,
   assessed methodological risk of bias, and extracted data from the
   full-text reports; disagreements were resolved by discussion with a
   third review author. To facilitate comparisons between studies, a
   standardized summary measure based on relative effects, rather than
   differences in effects, was defined for each outcome. Summary measures
   were calculated for all studies when possible. When at least three
   studies reported the same outcome, the results were pooled in a
   meta-analysis. Pooled meta-analyses were carried out when at least three
   studies reported the same outcome; otherwise, the results of individual
   studies were described in a narrative. Heterogeneity among effect
   estimates was assessed using chi (2) tests at a 5\% level of
   significance and quantified using the I-2 statistic. EMMIE framework
   data were coded using the EPPIE Reviewer database.
   ResultsThe results of this systematic review suggest that RLCs are
   associated with a statistically significant reduction in crash outcomes,
   although this varies by type of crash, and suggest a reduction in red
   light violations. RLCs are associated with a a 20\% decrease in total
   injury crashes, a 24\% decrease in right angle crashes and a 29\%
   decrease in right angle injury crashes. Conversely, however, RLCs are
   also associated with a statistically significant increase in rear end
   crashes of 19\%. There was also some evidence that RLCs were associated
   with a large reduction in crashes due to red light violations. There is
   no evidence to suggest that study heterogeneity is consistently
   explained by either country or risk of bias, nor did the presence or
   absence of warning signs appear to impact the effectiveness of RLCs.
   Studies accounting for regression to the mean tend to report more
   moderate decreases for right angle crashes resulting in injury than
   studies not accounting for regression to the mean. Studies with better
   control for confounders reported a nonsignificant decrease in right
   angle crashes, compared with a significant decrease for all studies.
   Authors' ConclusionsThe evidence suggests that RLCs may be effective in
   reducing red light violations and are likely to be effective in reducing
   some types of traffic crashes, although they also appear linked to an
   increase in rear end crashes. Several implications for policymakers and
   practitioners have emerged from this research. The costs and benefits of
   RLCs must be considered when implementing RLC programs. The potential
   benefits of a reduction in traffic violations and in some types of
   injury crashes must be weighed against the increased risk of other crash
   types. The economic implications of operating an RLC program also must
   be considered, including the costs of installation and operation as well
   as the economic impact of RLC effects.},

Title = {Self-reporting traffic crashes - a systematic literature review},
Journal = {EUROPEAN TRANSPORT RESEARCH REVIEW},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Purpose: A traffic safety analysis that is based on registered crashes
   often suffers from underreporting, which may result in biased
   conclusions and lead to misguided crash-prevention strategies.
   Self-reporting traffic crashes is a complementary method to obtain crash
   information that is often not available in official databases. By
   surveying studies from around the world, this paper aims to map the
   current practices in the collection of data from self-reporting traffic
   crashes.
   Method: A systematic literature search was carried out in three
   databases, ScienceDirect, Scopus and Transport Research International
   Documentation (TRID), resulting in 134 reviewed studies.
   Results: Self-reported crash studies were found to be more common in
   Europe, North America and Australasia, but there are few studies in
   developing countries. The reviewed studies mostly focused on adult road
   users (i.e. legal age of obtaining driving license and with no upper
   limit) and car users. Questionnaires (either paper based or online) were
   the most often used method, and 1 year was the most common recall period
   used. Regardless of its drawbacks, the reviewed studies showed that
   researchers `trust' self-reports.
   Conclusion: More studies should be conducted, especially targeting
   adolescent and young adults (age of 15-30 years) and vulnerable road
   users (VRUs). Developing countries should increase their efforts when it
   comes to using self-reporting to better assess the actual traffic safety
   situation and produce knowledge-based appropriate safety measures.
   Utilisation of smartphone application to assist data collection in
   self-reporting study for in-depth crash analysis should be explored
   further.},

   narrative reviews sampled via logistic regression},
Journal = {ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {98},
Pages = {57-63},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Speed is one of the most important factors in traffic safety as higher
   speeds are linked to increased crash risk and higher injury severities.
   Nearly a third of fatal crashes in the United States are designated as
   ``speeding-related{''}, which is defined as either ``the driver behavior
   of exceeding the posted speed limit or driving too fast for
   conditions.{''} While many studies have utilized the speeding-related
   designation in safety analyses, no studies have examined the underlying
   accuracy of this designation. Herein, we investigate the
   speeding-related crash designation through the development of a series
   of logistic regression models that were derived from the established
   speeding-related crash typologies and validated using a blind review, by
   multiple researchers, of 604 crash narratives. The developed logistic
   regression model accurately identified crashes which were not originally
   designated as speeding-related but had crash narratives that suggested
   speeding as a causative factor. Only 53.4\% of crashes designated as
   speeding related contained narratives which described speeding as a
   causative factor. Further investigation of these crashes revealed that
   the driver contributing code (DCC) of ``driving too fast for
   conditions{''} was being used in three separate situations.
   Additionally, this DCC was also incorrectly used when ``exceeding the
   posted speed limit{''} would likely have been a more appropriate
   designation. Finally, it was determined that the responding officer only
   utilized one DCC in 82\% of crashes not designated as speeding-related
   but contained a narrative indicating speed as a contributing causal
   factor. The use of logistic regression models based upon
   speeding-related crash typologies offers a promising method by which all
   possible speeding-related crashes could be identified. Published by

Title = {Speed cameras for the prevention of road traffic injuries and deaths},
Journal = {COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS},
Year = {2010},
Number = {10},
Abstract = {Background
   It is estimated that by 2020, road traffic crashes will have moved from
   ninth to third in the world ranking of burden of disease, as measured in
   disability adjusted life years. The prevention of road traffic injuries
   is of global public health importance. Measures aimed at reducing
   traffic speed are considered essential to preventing road injuries; the
   use of speed cameras is one such measure.
   Objectives
   To assess whether the use of speed cameras reduces the incidence of
   speeding, road traffic crashes, injuries and deaths.
   Search strategy
   We searched the following electronic databases covering all available
   years up to March 2010; the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (WebSPIRS), EMBASE
   (WebSPIRS), TRANSPORT, IRRD(International Road Research Documentation),
   TRANSDOC (European Conference of Ministers of Transport databases), Web
   of Science (Science and Social Science Citation Index), PsycINFO,
   CINAHL, EconLit, WHO database, Sociological Abstracts, Dissertation
   Abstracts, Index to Theses.
   Selection criteria
   Randomised controlled trials, interrupted time series and controlled
   before-after studies that assessed the impact of speed cameras on
   speeding, road crashes, crashes causing injury and fatalities were
   eligible for inclusion.
   Data collection and analysis
   We independently screened studies for inclusion, extracted data,
   assessed methodological quality, reported study authors' outcomes and
   where possible, calculated standardised results based on the information
   available in each study. Due to considerable heterogeneity between and
   within included studies, a meta-analysis was not appropriate.
   Main results
   Thirty five studies met the inclusion criteria. Compared with controls,
   the relative reduction in average speed ranged from 1\% to 15\% and the
   reduction in proportion of vehicles speeding ranged from 14\% to 65\%.
   In the vicinity of camera sites, the pre/post reductions ranged from 8\%
   to 49\% for all crashes and 11\% to 44\% for fatal and serious injury
   crashes. Compared with controls, the relative improvement in pre/post
   injury crash proportions ranged from 8\% to 50\%.
   Authors' conclusions
   Despite the methodological limitations and the variability in degree of
   signal to noise effect, the consistency of reported reductions in speed
   and crash outcomes across all studies show that speed cameras are a
   worthwhile intervention for reducing the number of road traffic injuries
   and deaths. However, whilst the the evidence base clearly demonstrates a
   positive direction in the effect, an overall magnitude of this effect is
   currently not deducible due to heterogeneity and lack of methodological
   rigour. More studies of a scientifically rigorous and homogenous nature
   are necessary, to provide the answer to the magnitude of effect.},

  abstract             = {Background
   Road traffic crashes are a major cause of death and injury, especially
   in low and middle-income countries. It is estimated that road traffic
   injuries will have risen from ninth to third in world disease burden
   rankings by 2020, accounting for 2.3 million deaths globally. Street
   lighting has been suggested as a relatively low cost intervention with
   the potential to prevent traffic crashes.
   Objectives
   To assess the effects of street lighting on injuries caused by road
   traffic crashes.
   Search strategy
   We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL,
   MEDLINE, EMBASE, TRANSPORT, Australian Transport Index. We also searched
   the Internet and checked reference lists of relevant papers. The search
   was not restricted by language or publication status. The searches were
   conducted to October 2008.
   Selection criteria
   Randomised controlled trials, non-randomised controlled trials and
   controlled before-after studies, comparing new street lighting with
   unlit roads, or improved street lighting with the pre-existing lighting
   level.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two authors screened search results, extracted data, assessed risk of
   bias and analysed the data.
   Main results
   We found 16 controlled before-after studies of street lighting, all
   reporting crash data, of which 14 contributed data to the meta-analysis.
   Seven trials included a designated control site, the other nine
   collected data at one site with the daytime data being used as the
   control. The methodological quality of the trials was generally poor.
   Three trials compared street lighting with an area control on total
   crashes; pooled rate ratio (RR) = 0.45 (95\% Confidence Interval (CI)
   0.29 to 0.69). Two trials compared street lighting with an area control
   on total injury crashes (all severities); RR = 0.78 (95\% CI 0.63 to
   0.97). No trials compared the number of fatal crashes with an area
   control.
   Ten trials compared street lighting with a day time control on total
   crashes; pooled RR = 0.68 (95\% CI 0.56 to 0.83). Five trials compared
   street lighting with a day time control on total injury crashes; pooled
   RR = 0.68 (95\% CI 0.59 to 0.79). Three trials compared street lighting
   with a day time control on fatal crashes; pooled RR = 0.33 (95\% CI 0.17
   to 0.66).
   Authors' conclusions
   The results from this systematic review suggests that street lighting
   may prevent road traffic crashes, injuries and fatalities. However,
   further well designed studies are needed to determine the effectiveness
   of street lighting in middle and low-income countries.},

Title = {Increased police patrols for preventing alcohol-impaired driving},
Journal = {COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS},
Year = {2008},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {Background
   Road traffic injuries cause 1.2 million deaths worldwide each year.
   Alcohol consumption increases the risk of traffic crashes, especially
   fatal crashes. Increased police patrols aim to increase both the
   perceived and actual likelihood of being caught driving while
   alcohol-impaired, potentially reducing alcohol-related driving, crashes
   and injuries.
   Objectives
   To assess the effects on injuries and crashes of increased police
   patrols that target alcohol-impaired driving.
   Search strategy
   We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register (5/2006),
   CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to 5/2006),
   TRANSPORT (1968 to 5/2006), C2-SPECTR (2/2005), NCJRS ( 1/1951 to
   5/2006), PsycINFO(1872 to 5/2006), Social Science Citation Index (1974
   to 5/2006), SIGLE (1980 to 2/2006), Science Citation Index Expanded
   (1970 to 5/2006), Dissertation Abstracts ( 1870 to 5/2006), NTIS (1964
   to 12/2004), conference proceedings, and reference lists. We contacted
   authors of eligible studies.
   Selection criteria
   Randomized controlled trials, controlled trials, controlled before and
   after studies, interrupted time series (ITS) studies, and controlled ITS
   studies evaluating increased police patrols, either alone or combined
   with other interventions, targeting alcohol-impaired motor vehicle
   drivers.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two investigators independently screened citations, extracted data, and
   assessed quality criteria. We compared intervention and no-intervention
   geographical areas or time periods. We re-analyzed study data as
   required. Results are presented narratively.
   Main results
   The 32 eligible studies included one randomized controlled trial, eight
   controlled before-after studies, 14 controlled ITS studies, six ITS
   studies, and three studies with both ITS and controlled before-after
   analyses. Most interventions targeted only alcohol-impaired driving
   (69\%) and included additional interventions such as media campaigns or
   special training for police officers (91\%). Only two studies reported
   sufficient information to assess study quality completely. Two-thirds of
   studies were scored `not adequate' on at least one feature. Five of six
   studies evaluating traffic fatalities reported reductions with the
   intervention, but differences were statistically significant in only one
   study. Effects of intervention on traffic injuries were inconsistent in
   the six studies evaluating this outcome, and no results were
   statistically significant. All four controlled studies evaluating fatal
   crashes reported reductions with the intervention, which were
   statistically significant in one study. All 12 controlled studies
   assessing injury crashes reported greater reductions with the
   intervention, though effects were minimal or not significant in several
   studies. ITS studies showed less consistent effects on fatal crashes
   (three studies) and injury crashes (four studies), and effect estimates
   were typically imprecise. Thirteen of 20 studies showed reductions in
   total crashes and about two-thirds of these were statistically
   significant.
   Authors' conclusions
   Studies examining increased police patrol programs were generally
   consistent in reporting beneficial effects on traffic crashes and
   fatalities, but study quality and reporting were often poor.
   Methodological limitations included inadequate sample size, dissimilar
   baseline measures, contamination, and inadequate data analysis. Thus
   existing evidence, although supportive, does not firmly establish
   whether increased police patrols, implemented with or without other
   intervention elements, reduce the adverse consequences of
   alcohol-impaired driving.},

Title = {Speed enforcement detection devices for preventing road traffic injuries},
Journal = {COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS},
Year = {2006},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Background It is estimated that by 2020, road traffic crashes will have
   moved from ninth to third in the world ranking of burden of disease, as
   measured in disability adjusted life years. The identification of
   effective strategies for the prevention of road traffic injuries is of
   global public health importance. Measures aimed at reducing traffic
   speed are considered essential to preventing road injuries; the use of
   speed enforcement detection devices (including speed cameras and radar
   and laser devices) is one such measure.
   Objectives To assess whether the use of speed enforcement detection
   devices (SEDs) reduces the incidence of speeding, road traffic crashes,
   injuries and deaths.
   Search strategy We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised
   Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science (and Social Science)
   Citation Index, TRANSPORT, PsycINFO, CINAHL, EconLit. We searched the
   websites of road safety and motoring associations, as well as general
   internet searches. We handsearched selected journals and conference
   proceedings, and contacted experts in the field. The searches were
   conducted during May to November 2004.
   Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials and controlled
   before-after studies that assessed the impact of speed enforcement
   detection devices on speeding, road crashes, injuries and deaths were
   eligible for inclusion. For studies involving co-interventions, SEDs had
   to be the major intervention focus of the study to be eligible.
   Data collection and analysis We independently screened search results,
   assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed
   methodological quality. Due to variability between and within included
   studies, a pooled analysis was not appropriate.
   Main results No randomised controlled trials were identified. Twenty-six
   studies met the inclusion criteria, of which 22 were controlled
   before-after trials incorporating a distinct control or comparison
   group(s) and four were interrupted time series designs with a comparison
   group(s). Fourteen studies reported speed and crash outcomes, seven
   reported crash outcomes only and five reported speed outcomes only. All
   but one study reported an absolute reduction in pre/post average speeds.
   A pre/post reduction in the proportion of speeding vehicles ranged
   across studies from 5\% to 70\% depending on the speed threshold set.
   Pre/post reductions of 50\% to 65\% were reported in the proportion of
   speeding vehicles travelling 15 km/h over the speed limit. Compared with
   controls, the relative improvement was from 1\% to 15\% for average
   speed and from 14\% to 65\% for percent speeding.
   All studies reporting crash outcomes reported an absolute pre/post
   reduction in all crashes and injury related crashes. In the vicinity of
   camera sites these pre/post reductions ranged from 14\% to 72\% for all
   crashes, 8\% to 46\% for injury crashes, and 40\% to 45\% for crashes
   resulting in fatalities or serious injuries. More generalised effects
   over wider areas showed an absolute pre/post crash reduction ranging
   from 9\% to 35\%, 7\% to 30\% for all injury crashes and 13\% to 58\%
   for crashes resulting in fatalities alone, or in combination with
   serious injuries. The studies of longer duration showed that these
   positive trends were either maintained or improved with time. Compared
   with controls, the relative improvement in pre/post crash numbers
   resulting in any type of injury ranged from 5\% to 36\%.
   Authors' conclusions Despite the methodological limitations of the
   studies reviewed, the consistency of reported positive reductions in
   speed and crash outcomes across all studies suggest that SEDs are a
   promising intervention for reducing the number of road traffic injuries
   and deaths. More studies of a scientifically rigorous nature are
   necessary to provide a stronger evidence base that these interventions
   are worthwhile. There is a need for international harmonisation of data
   collection methods, including standards on how best to measure speeds
   and collect crash data, over lengthy intervention and follow-up periods,
   as well as some consensus as to the expression of outcomes in studies,
   so that studies can be compared.},

    Geographical Trends:
        Identify crash hotspots by region or city.
        Map high-frequency crash areas and correlate with traffic volumes, infrastructure, or road types.
        Determine if certain types of roads (e.g., highways, local roads) have more incidents than others.

    Temporal Trends:
        Determine if there are specific times of the year, month, or week when crashes are more common (e.g., holiday seasons, weekends).
        Analyze if there are patterns in crash timings, like during rush hours.

    Vehicle Types:
        Identify if certain vehicle types (e.g., trucks, motorcycles, electric cars) are more prone to accidents.
        Investigate the age of vehicles involved in accidents to see if older vehicles are more prone to crashes.

    Correlation with Population and Economic Indicators:
        Assess if areas with a higher population or economic growth have a proportional increase in road crashes.
        Compare the number of crashes to the total number of registered vehicles in an area.

    Comparative Analysis with Cultural Indicators:
        Investigate if areas with certain cultural events or festivities have a spike in road accidents.

    Vehicle Registration Data:
        Check if there's a pattern regarding newly registered vehicles and their involvement in accidents. For instance, are newer drivers more prone to accidents?

    Weather Patterns:
        While this data may not be directly provided in the mentioned datasets, it would be interesting to correlate crash data with weather conditions. Do crashes increase during rainy or icy conditions?

    Vehicle Manufacturer Data:
        Explore if certain car brands or models are more involved in accidents, which could highlight possible defects or safety issues.

    Ethical Aspects:
        Determine if certain demographics (based on vehicle type, location, etc.) are more prone to accidents and the implications of such findings.

hase 1 Report Marking Scheme
Assignment 3, which is an interim report on the project, will be submitted as a joint report.
The marking scheme outlined below is a guide. Clearly in some proposals more thought and effort
will be needed in some aspects of the proposal (to satisfactorily address the issues) than is indicated
in this average marking scheme. Also the list here is not meant to be exhaustive, or relevant to every
proposal. It is given to jog your memory.
The interim report should have the following content:
Title
• Project title, names and IDs of students in your project group, date of submission
Background and Data [1-3 pages]
• State which dataset(s) your group worked on, and their source
• Explain briefly why the dataset is of interest, or what questions it could be used to answer;
assume that the reader has never heard of your dataset
• State the types of data in the dataset(s) and the structure of the dataset(s). Are the data nu-
merical, categorical, or both? Time series? Coordinates? Diagnostic categories? This does NOT
need to be an exhaustive list of every variable, just a few comments on the overall types.
• State how complete the dataset(s) are (i.e. how many missing, any structure to the missing data,
whether there are errors in the data)
• If you used more than one dataset, state what steps you had to take to integrate the datasets
Ethics, Privacy and Security [1-2 pages]
• Brief discussion of any ethical considerations that apply to your project
• Brief discussion of any privacy concerns that might arise connected to your project
• Brief discussion of what steps you could take to keep your project data and results secure (you
do NOT need to carry this out, you just need to talk about it in the report)
Exploratory Data Analysis [3-6 pages]
For this section, do NOT try to summarize everything you can find in the dataset(s). Select a
subset, highlighting features that you thought were interesting in the data. The plots do not have to
be complicated; simple bar charts and scatter plots are fine.
• Several summary tables and/or plots, each describing one, two or three variables in the data
that you thought were interesting
• Explain the definitions of the variables in each table/plot
• Comment on the main features of each plot
• Include suitable labels and keys for each plot
• Make sure all plots would be readable if printed in black & white, and adjust the point sizes
and/or line thicknesses to improve readability
• Lay out all tables so that they are clearly readable and clearly labelled, and do not use excessive
significant figures
• All figures and tables should be numbered and should have captions
Individual Contributions [1 page]
• State what contribution each member of the group made to the data preparation, the analysis
and the report
Overall Report These marks will be awarded for overall presentation, clarity and quality of the report.
In particular, marks will be awarded for
• A clear logical layout
• Keeping to the page limits for each section, and using sensible font size
• Key facts being easily located

    
Interactions
- Maginal information is not enought. 
- Start simple, and increase complexity of model. 

Interaction between speed and weather is the most relevant factor for bad crashed, turns out to be irrelevent for mild ones. 

Sensitivity analysis of regression: 

Weather: Categoriatal 
- Sensitivity aalysis 
  - How much does crash change, when weather modves. (Category will jump, crash will increase )
  - Sensitivity, gradient for numerical, jumps for categorical. 
  - Find ratio between how much 1 changes the other. 
  
  
  Gantt: 
  - Split into 12 weeks
  - Interested in how to group 
    
  -   Checking 
  -   Cleaning 
  
  KanBan 
  - Used to answer the why, who, where
  
  
  Define which are Character, Factors, Numerical, categorical. 
  - Analysis of missing datapoints 
  - Analaysis of varibles. 
  - Plot all variables against major / fatal crashes. 
  - Combine variables (Major / Fatal?)
  - Use the EDA package recconmended in announcement.

Possible questions: 
  
Improve Outcomes:
        How can we reduce the number of fatal crashes by providing a risk tool that allows government to better focus their road safety efforts.
        
        How can we use statistical inference and modelling tools using CAS Crash data to allow for better roading outcomes. 
        
        How can we use CAS Crash Data and other NZStats datasets to provide statistical inference to model relationships between demographic factors and crash data. 
        

Questions for Alejandro: 
- Is there a specific direction that you are looking for us to go with the project. 
- How big should our scope be? 
        - How detailed of an analysis do we need for a good grade? 
        - What happens if we cant finish an ambiguious goal? 
        - What are the criteria that we will be marked on? 
        - Whats the level of colaboration allows for the individual report phase? 
- Can we use just the CAS dataset, or do we need to merge datasets? 
  
Ethical Aspects:
        Determine if certain demographics (based on vehicle type, location, etc.) are more prone to accidents and the implications of such findings.
        
Correlation with Population and Economic Indicators:
        Assess if areas with a higher population or economic growth have a proportional increase in road crashes.
        Compare the number of crashes to the total number of registered vehicles in an area.
  
- Do speed cameras reduce crashes 
- Does the type of vehicle affect crash outcome (has it changed over time)
- Do public holidays have any impact on crash data
- Does the democratic of the crash area affect the outcome 

    
    
    
    Geographical Trends:
        Identify crash hotspots by region or city.
        Map high-frequency crash areas and correlate with traffic volumes, infrastructure, or road types.
        Determine if certain types of roads (e.g., highways, local roads) have more incidents than others.

    Temporal Trends:
        Determine if there are specific times of the year, month, or week when crashes are more common (e.g., holiday seasons, weekends).
        Analyze if there are patterns in crash timings, like during rush hours.

    Vehicle Types:
        Identify if certain vehicle types (e.g., trucks, motorcycles, electric cars) are more prone to accidents.
        Investigate the age of vehicles involved in accidents to see if older vehicles are more prone to crashes.

 

    Comparative Analysis with Cultural Indicators:
        Investigate if areas with certain cultural events or festivities have a spike in road accidents.

    Vehicle Registration Data:
        Check if there's a pattern regarding newly registered vehicles and their involvement in accidents. For instance, are newer drivers more prone to accidents?

    Weather Patterns:
        While this data may not be directly provided in the mentioned datasets, it would be interesting to correlate crash data with weather conditions. Do crashes increase during rainy or icy conditions?

    Vehicle Manufacturer Data:
        Explore if certain car brands or models are more involved in accidents, which could highlight possible defects or safety issues.
